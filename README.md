Medium Any Author Stats is a tool to see detailed statistics of all the authors on the Medium website. All you need to do is to enter the Medium author's page and load their data.

The extension will show you information about:
- number of followers
- total posts number
- how many posts are locked for medium subscribers
- number of newsletter subscribers
- if the author is a medium subscriber (and how long)
- claps, responses and amount of clappers with the aggregated view as well as for individual posts.
